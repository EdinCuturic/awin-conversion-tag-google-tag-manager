# Awin Conversion Tag - Google Tag Manager

The template works by appending our sale attribution technology onto your shop website and populating the relevant variables required to record conversions for your affiliate programme. Use of the Awin Conversion Tag template will not change the appearance of your e-commerce site.

To use this template you must have an Awin advertiser account, please contact our sales department for further information if you wish to join as an advertiser. Additional fees apply.

# Features

**Enhanced Sale Attribution**  is our core tracking technology, which directly feeds into our reporting suite at Awin. These transactions are transparently displayed in the Awin interface.

**Voucher Code Tracking** Voucher/Coupon code tracking is an effective way for advertisers to monitor the vouchers used in a transaction. The data is clearly highlighted to advertisers through the Awin interface and you can choose to accept/decline commission based on the usage of non-compliant voucher codes.

**Product Level Tracking (PLT)** enables an advertiser to produce more in-depth reporting where the performance of individual products can easily be measured. Monitor the effectiveness of different product promotions and their impact on consumersâ€™ buying behaviour in the affiliate channel.
